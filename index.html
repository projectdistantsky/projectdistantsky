        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>It is time to stop looking away; it is time to revert global warming. Let's build regenerative houses in zero-waste neighborhoods, inside self-sufficient districts, in smart cities, powered by clean energy, designed to emit nothing. At the core of each city: a tower that filters carbon and methane from the air. Not neutral. Reversal.</p>
        <p>Now imagine every city in the world with one of these towers. Capture systems across the countryside. Zero local emissions. And a drop in global temperature.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>The climate crisis is reversible.</p>
        <p>Global temperatures are rising fast. Carbon and methane emissions are choking our planet, pushing us towards an irreversible brink of floods, droughts, food shortages, and mass migrations.</p>
        <p>This blueprint isn’t just hope. It’s a plan backed by science and scalable tech, designed to turn back the clock on global warming and secure a livable future.</p>
        <p>And the best part? Most of the technology needed already exists. This is not science fiction.</p>

  <!-- THE BASICS -->
  <section class="basics">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p><b>A decentralized, renewable energy grid.</b> Each neighborhood generates its own power through solar panels and next-generation batteries. Energy is stored locally and shared across the network to ensure maximum efficiency and resilience. This model reduces dependence on fossil fuels and eliminates emissions from power generation.</p>
        <p><b>Passive cooling urbanism.</b> We design our urban environments with materials that actively help regulate temperature. Roads and rooftops are covered with reflective and porous surfaces that reduce heat absorption. Buildings use thermal shielding and natural airflow to maintain comfortable indoor climates with minimal energy use. The city itself becomes a cooling system instead of a heat trap.</p>
        <p><b>Direct air capture & repurposing.</b> At the center of the city stands a carbon and methane capture tower. These towers filter greenhouse gases directly from the air. Once captured, the carbon and methane are processed and repurposed, turned into fuel and building materials. The more towers we build, the more we can reverse the trend of rising temperatures.</p>

  <!-- MODEL -->
  <section class="model">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Model</h2>
        <p>This proposal is (very) expensive. Pharaonic. And yet, it is the only cost-effective option available.</p>
        <p>The truth? This model isn’t just good for the planet: it’s great economics. It creates millions of jobs, stabilizes energy costs, reduces disaster risks, and opens up entirely new industries. Every dollar invested today prevents billions in systemic losses tomorrow.</p>
        <p>This blueprint is designed to scale to the whole planet. The first phase is pragmatic, funded and implemented by a small, focused group to establish viability. In the final stage, yes, a global mobilization will be required—an effort with no precedent. This is inevitable. The physics of our climate demand it. The only question remaining is if we will start in time. While it may be late in some regards, I've developed an <b>R+D acceleration method to speed up the process.</b></p>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Is this really possible with today’s technology?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Yes. The core technologies (Direct Air Capture, next-gen energy storage, regenerative materials, reforestation) already exist. The challenge isn't invention, it's integration, scaling, and focused R&D, which this blueprint is designed to catalyze.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Are ALL needed technologies already invented?</strong>
        <div class="answer">No. But the remaining challenges are matters of engineering, not violations of physics. I’ve designed a method for quick R&D. Details in the whitepaper.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How much will it cost to build the first city?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Somewhere between $100 and $300 billion. It's a pharaonic number for a pharaonic task, but we won't start with a city.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Who’s funding this?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Nobody. The whole point is for everyone to start funding it. The first dime will come from the first person of consequence who reads it and understands that the alternative is unthinkable.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Where will the first prototypes be built?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Theoretically speaking, it could be anywhere. The closest possible thing to an answer would be “Wherever someone with the means supports the project”.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>What makes this different from other green city projects?</strong>
        <div class="answer">I haven’t seen any proposal to revert climate change. This is mine. Also, is not strictly a green city.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How do the towers actually remove carbon and methane?</strong>
        <div class="answer">By filtering air. The technology already exists, but it needs to be scaled up and improved.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>What happens to the captured gases?</strong>
        <div class="answer">The tower would be able to repurpose it into new fuel for heat and raw materials for industries.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How will you prevent corruption or inefficiency?</strong>
        <div class="answer">I won’t. Not completely. This is a human project, not a utopian fantasy. But I'll take the risk of human corruption over the certainty of climate extinction every single time.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Why not just focus on reducing emissions?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Because we’re too far gone. Even if we hit zero emissions this year, the damage already done will keep hitting us in the form of floods and crop losses so severe that famine would be inevitable.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Is this a non-profit, a business, or a political movement?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Yes. It's a hybrid. The final legal structure will have to be as innovative as the technology itself, shaped by the foundational partners to maximize speed and global impact.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Share. That’s all you can do right now. There will be more in the future, but at this point, the only thing anyone can ask from you is to spread the word.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>And if nobody steps in with cash?</strong>
        <div class="answer">Then I've failed. Anyway, I don't surrender easily.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Who are you, people?</strong>
        <div class="answer">I am a nobody with a plan. And that’s the best humanity could come up with.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Then why do you think it has to be you?</strong>
        <div class="answer">I’m in my early forties. I’ve been aware of global warming for a long time now. And all this time, I’ve waited to see someone step in. Nobody did. I’m ditching the bystander effect right now and doing something, even if what I can actually do on my own is very little.</div>
      </div>
